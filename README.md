This is a custom theme for the Markdown editor [Typora](https://typora.io/).

My custom Typora theme is now featured on the official site! 🎉
Check it out here: [Typora Themes](https://theme.typora.io/)

Feedback is always welcome! If you encounter any issues or have a suggestion, please don't hesitate to create an issue.

# Introduce

- **Notion-like design** for a clean and minimal look.
- **Compact file tree** to display more files and directories.
- **Precise replication** of Notion’s aesthetics.
- The file tree and outline styles are based on [Mdmdt](https://theme.typora.io/theme/Mdmdt/). Adjustments have been made to the size, color, and some elements to better integrate with the overall Notion-like theme.

# Theme Variants

This repo provides a Notion-like theme as the default, plus an optional variant.

## Default

- `notion-style-light.css`
- `notion-style-dark.css`

## Variant: Enhanced

- `notion-style-light-enhanced.css`
- `notion-style-dark-enhanced.css`

This variant focuses on readability and Typora usability, and may look different from Notion.
